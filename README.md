# playwright_test
Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:
```
using Microsoft.Playwright;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class PlaywrightExample
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
        await using var browser = await playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync();
        var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();

        await page.GotoAsync("https://www.microsoft.com");
        // other actions...
    }
}
```
